										<h2>A look into my life</h2>
										<p>Click on <a href="http://pitt.edu/~pkk6/">*me*</a> to se the website that I made during my freshman year at Pitt.</p>
									</header>
									<p>I am a student currently studying at the University of Pittsburgh as a computer engineering major. I was born on August 31st in Milpitas, California. I lived in Milpitas for the first 12 years of my life where I got the opportunity to experience both a public as well as private form of education, met many new people, and make many new friends. After this time, my parents decided to temporarily relocate half way around the world to my home country India so that I may meet my family there as well as learn more about my cultural background.</p>

									<p>The summer of 2005 I left my home in the USA for India. I moved into a house in Hyderabad, India and soon afterwards enrolled into a school called, Oakridge International School. At Oakridge, I met many new students and made a lot of friends as well. During my stay in India, I got a unique glimpse into my culture that I otherwise would not have experienced back in the USA. My friends introduced me to the culture, language, festives, food and many other unique aspects of my culture. </p>

												<h4>Distance Road Biking</h4>
												<p>I love biking for so many reasons, but especially for the community it builds. Everyday on my way out all the commuters give a little nod or wave to each other. Do we do that in cars when we see each other everyday?</p>

												<h4>My Animals</h4>
												<p>I love my animals as they're part of my family. I have 2 dogs and 2 birds. I love them as when we bought them they were part of our family. We feed them and do everything we do for any other family member. My pets are so loving and we are so loving back.</p>

												<h4>Food & Cuisine</h4>
												<p>I think that one of the reasons that I first fell in-love with cooking was that food is the universal love language. No matter who you are, you need food to live. It trascends cultures and language barriers: everyone, anywhere, eats. And everyone loves nice tasting food, so we all flock to it.</p>
